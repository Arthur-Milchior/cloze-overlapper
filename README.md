### Background
 
Memorizing lists and enumerations has always been a particularly difficult part of studying flashcards. Good flashcards follow the **minimum information principle**, where the content of each card is reduced to its essentials; but sequential information can not always be sensibly chunked down to its constituents. Because each item of a sequence builds on the next, methods like grouping or categorizing are usually not a viable option.

One of the [common recommendations](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/20rules#Enumerations) for cases like this is to create **informationally overlapping flashcards**, where the answer to each card serves as a prompt for the next, e.g.:

    List items:           A        B        C        D
    Resulting cards:  ->A | A -> B | B -> C | C -> D | D->

While this can be highly effective, creating cards like these manually can also be an enormous **time-sink**. For that reason students will usually opt against implementing this method in their own studying routine, even though it might result in a much better retention rate in the long run. 

### The Add-on

This is where *Cloze Overlapper* comes in: Instead of writing a flashcard for each pair of list items, you simply type in the sequence in its entirety and **let the add-on generate the cards** for you. The cards will only provide you with the context you need to recall each item at hand. This will result in a **chain of overlapping associations** between each sequence node, potentially strengthening your memory and improving your recall performance.

Both the number of context cues and the length of each prompt can be **freely customized** on a per-note basis, allowing you to adjust Cloze Overlapper for whatever purpose you see fit:

Cards generated with this add-on are fully compatible with **all platforms**, AnkiMobile and AnkiDroid included:
